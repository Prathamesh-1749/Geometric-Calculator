#classes
This folder was created to store the Java files.
Some Java files are stored in packages. But don't worry, packages will be created once you run the code.
 If you make any change in the Java Servlets code, then compile it with the ("javac LoginServlet.java")command in the command prompt, and if you want to compile a Java package, then use("javac -d . RegistrationServlet.java")command in the command prompt.
