# Geometric-Calculator
A geometric calculator using Java Web Development. It is designed to simplify and automate complex geometric computations in an interactive, user-friendly way. The goal of the Geometric Calculator project is to design and develop a web-based application using Java technologies that can accurately perform various geometric calculations, such as area, perimeter, surface area, and volume, for different shapes. The project aims to provide users with a simple, interactive, and efficient platform that eliminates the need for manual computation. By integrating Java Servlets, JSP, and database connectivity, the application seeks to demonstrate the practical implementation of web technologies while enhancing user experience through a responsive and intuitive interface. Ultimately, the goal is to combine mathematical accuracy with modern web development practices to create a reliable educational and professional tool.
Also added user authentication, like login, registration.
